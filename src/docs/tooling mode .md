Yes, absolutely. In the context of the OpenAI API, the two concepts are not just compatible; they are fundamentally linked. **You build an agent by using the tool-calling feature within a loop.**

The OpenAI API does not have a simple `"mode": "agent"` parameter. Instead, it provides the essential building block—**Tool Calling** (also known as Function Calling)—and you, the developer, implement the agentic behavior by orchestrating the API calls.

Here’s how it works in practice:

### The Agentic Loop with OpenAI's API

An "agent" is essentially a loop in your own application code that wraps the OpenAI Chat Completions API.

**1. Define the Goal & Tools:**
*   The user provides a high-level goal (e.g., "Summarize the main points of this article and email the summary to my team").
*   You, the developer, define a set of available functions (tools) that the model can use, such as `fetch_article_content(url)`, `summarize_text(text)`, and `send_email(recipient, subject, body)`.

**2. Initial API Call (The "Think" Step):**
*   Your code sends the user's goal and the list of available tools to the OpenAI API (`/v1/chat/completions`).
*   **You:** `POST /v1/chat/completions`
    *   `model`: "gpt-4o"
    *   `messages`: `[{"role": "user", "content": "Summarize https://example.com/article and email it to team@example.com"}]`
    *   `tools`: `[...definitions for fetch_article_content, summarize_text, send_email...]`

**3. Model Responds with a Tool Call (The "Plan" Step):**
*   The model analyzes the request and decides the first logical step is to get the article content.
*   Instead of a text response, the API returns a `finish_reason` of `tool_calls` and a `tool_calls` object.
*   **OpenAI API:**
    ```json
    {
      "choices": [{
        "finish_reason": "tool_calls",
        "message": {
          "role": "assistant",
          "tool_calls": [{
            "id": "call_abc123",
            "type": "function",
            "function": {
              "name": "fetch_article_content",
              "arguments": "{\"url\": \"https://example.com/article\"}"
            }
          }]
        }
      }]
    }
    ```

**4. Your Code Executes the Tool (The "Act" Step):**
*   Your application code parses this response. It sees the model wants to run `fetch_article_content`.
*   Your code **actually executes** this function. It makes an HTTP request to the URL and gets the article text. This happens entirely outside of the OpenAI API.

**5. Second API Call with Tool Result (The "Observe" Step):**
*   Your code then calls the Chat Completions API *again*, appending the result of the tool execution to the message history. This tells the model what happened when it tried to act.
*   **You:** `POST /v1/chat/completions`
    *   `messages`: `[ `
        `{"role": "user", ...},`
        `{"role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [...]},`
        `{"role": "tool", "tool_call_id": "call_abc123", "content": "The article text is..."}`
      `]`
    *   `tools`: `[...]`

**6. Loop or Conclude:**
*   The model now has the article content. It re-evaluates the original goal. It knows it still needs to summarize and email.
*   It will likely respond with another `tool_calls` object, this time requesting to use the `summarize_text` function.
*   Your application **loops**, executing this new tool call, and sends the result back again.
*   This continues until the model determines the goal is complete. At that point, it will finally respond with a natural language message for the user (e.g., "I have sent the summary to your team.").

### Summary: Brain vs. Hands

Think of it this way:
*   **The OpenAI Model is the "Brain"**: It does the reasoning, planning, and decides *what* to do next (which tool to call).
*   **Your Application Code is the "Hands" / "Orchestrator"**: It's the agentic part that executes the tools, manages the state (the message history), and continuously communicates with the brain until the job is done.

So, to answer your question directly: **Yes, the two modes are used together because the agentic pattern is the architectural result of using the tool-calling feature in a persistent loop.** Frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex are popular precisely because they provide a robust, pre-built implementation of this agentic loop.
