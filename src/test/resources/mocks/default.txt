To use the mock server, send a prompt containing the following instruction:

  use mock <file_path>

Where <file_path> is the path to a mock file relative to "src/test/resources/mocks".

The file name can be unquoted or enclosed in single quotes.
For example:

- use mock my_file.txt
- use mock 'my file with spaces.json'
